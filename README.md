# Assignment 3 – Advanced Portfolio Website

## 📖 Project Description
This project is the third stage of my personal portfolio website.  
It builds on Assignments 1 and 2 by adding **advanced functionality**, such as:

- External API integration (GitHub API)
- Complex filtering, sorting, and dynamic UI updates
- Improved state management (saved username, theme, login state)
- Validation logic and interactive UI components
- Performance optimization (lazy-loaded images, reduced DOM updates)
- Enhanced animations and transitions

The goal was to create a feature-rich, responsive, and interactive portfolio that demonstrates advanced JavaScript skills and modern web-development practices.
