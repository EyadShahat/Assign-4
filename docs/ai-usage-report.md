# AI Usage Report – Assignment 3

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
- (Optional) GitHub Copilot for small autocomplete suggestions

---

## 📌 Use Cases

### 1. Debugging & Troubleshooting
AI helped me diagnose and fix several issues related to:
- Fetching data from the GitHub API  
- Handling errors and retry logic  
- Improving sorting and filtering logic  
- Fixing collapsible project card bugs  
- Dark/light theme persistence issues  

AI explanations helped me understand *why* some bugs happened and how to correct them.

---

### 2. Feature Development & Logic Planning
AI assisted with:
- Structuring the GitHub repo section (sorting + filtering + UI states)
- Designing state-management logic using `localStorage`
- Planning step-by-step logic for:
  - Login simulation toggle
  - Project filters (beginner/advanced)
  - Show/Hide projects
  - Search + filter + sorting combined

AI provided examples and explanations, but I adapted each feature into my own code.

---

### 3. Code Optimization & Performance
AI recommended:
- Lazy-loading images for faster page load  
- Using `IntersectionObserver` instead of scroll events  
- Avoiding repeated DOM queries  
- Splitting logic into clear sections  
- Using async/await instead of nested `.then()` chains  

I reviewed each suggestion and implemented the ones that made sense.

---

### 4. Documentation Support
AI helped draft:
- README formatting  
- Section descriptions  
- Feature explanations  
- This AI usage report template  

All content was reviewed and rewritten in my own words to ensure understanding.

---

## 🎯 Benefits
- Faster identification of bugs  
- Cleaner and more readable JavaScript structure  
- Better project planning flow  
- Improved performance through targeted optimizations  
- Clearer documentation

---

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Some AI suggestions were too advanced or irrelevant and required simplification  
- GitHub API rate limits occasionally caused errors during testing  
- Needed to be careful not to copy full AI blocks — instead, I rewrote and customized them  
- Some debugging steps still required manual testing and browser console investigation  

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Stronger understanding of async JavaScript and APIs  
- Better problem-solving approach with stepwise logic  
- Improved state-management techniques  
- More confidence writing modular and efficient JavaScript  
- Better awareness of when AI suggestions should be modified or discarded  

---

## 🤝 Responsible Use
- AI **did not** complete the assignment for me  
- I used AI mainly as a support tool for:
  - Debugging  
  - Logic brainstorming  
  - Performance ideas  
  - Documentation clarity  

All code was implemented, tested, and modified **by me**, and all AI-generated parts were adapted to match assignment requirements and my own understanding.
